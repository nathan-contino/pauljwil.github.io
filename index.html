<h1>Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
<p>I'm a technical writer in the Pacific Northwest with over ten yearsâ€™
   experience in technical, academic, and legal writing. Some of my strengths
   include cross-functional collaboration, project management, and quickly
   learning new technologies.</p>
<p>I've worked for the past two years as a full-time and freelance technical
   writer, focussing primarily on cloud computing, containerization, and
   orchestration technologies. My expertise lies in docs-as-code tooling, API
   documentation, and maintaining large and complex documentation sets, with a
   passion for information architecture and user experience.</p>
<p>Some of the things I value are simplicity, humility, and effective
   communication.</p>
