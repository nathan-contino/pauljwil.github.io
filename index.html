<h1>Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
<p>I'm a writer living in the Pacific Northwest. I have over ten years’ experience in academic and legal writing. Some of my strengths include cross-functional collaboration, project management, and quickly learning new technologies.<br><br>Over the past two years I’ve taken courses in technical writing, docs-as-code tooling, web development, API documentation, and UX.<br><br>To give you a little more insight into me as a person, some of the things I value are simplicity, humility, and cultivating understanding.</p>
