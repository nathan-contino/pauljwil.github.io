This page includes samples of my technical and academic writing for developer, end user, and academic audiences.

## API Documentation

### [Sidescale API](../sidescale-api)

[Sidescale](sidescale.com) is a cloud services platform which makes use of the Apache CloudStack API. I am currently building conceptual and reference documentation for their implementation of 253 of the CloudStack API requests. The following links to a working draft of that documentation. This is an example of my writing intended for a developer audience.

## Tutorials

### [Basic Markdown Tutorial](https://dev.to/pauljwil/basic-markdown-tutorial-1bof)

### [Linking to CSS and JavaScript in an HTML File](https://dev.to/pauljwil/linking-to-css-and-javascript-in-an-html-file-306m)

### [Connect GitHub Pages to Your Namecheap Domain](https://dev.to/pauljwil/connect-github-pages-to-your-namecheap-domain-4gjj)

These three tutorials explain relatively simple technical tasks and are intended to give you a sense of how I write for end users.

## Academic Writing

### [*Classical Indian Philosophy of Induction: The NyƒÅya Viewpoint* by Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti](/assets/pdfs/paul-williams-writing-sample-book-review.pdf)

This is an example of the writing I did while I was a graduate student in philosophy. It's a book review. Finally, this is an example of my writing intended for an academic audience.
