Here are some of the technical writing projects I've worked on recently:

[Basic Markdown Tutorial](https://dev.to/pauljwil/basic-markdown-tutorial-1bof)

[Linking to CSS and JavaScript in an HTML File](https://dev.to/pauljwil/linking-to-css-and-javascript-in-an-html-file-306m)

[Connect GitHub Pages to Your Namecheap Domain](https://dev.to/pauljwil/connect-github-pages-to-your-namecheap-domain-4gjj)

This is an example of the writing I did while I was a graduate student in philosophy:

[*Classical Indian Philosophy of Induction: The NyƒÅya Viewpoint* by Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti](/assets/pdfs/paul-williams-writing-sample-book-review.pdf)
