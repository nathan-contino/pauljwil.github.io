I've spent the much of my adult life undertaking projects in music and philosophy. The common thread in all my pursuits is a passion for communication. Working for the past two years at PopSockets, I uncovered exactly how to put this passion to work in my professional life: by writing crisp, effective documentation for customers and internal teams.

As a graduate student, I studied analytic and classical Indian Buddhist philosophy. My masters thesis dealt with the philosophy of emotion, moral psychology, and personal identity, focussing on the nature of compassion.

I've played music since I was a kid. I began learning electric bass when I was twelve, studied music composition as an undergraduate, and played in numerous groups along the way. I recorded two albums of all original music soon after finishing college.

These days I live in Portland, OR with my partner and her two sons. When the weather's nice we go out of our way to visit the many bodies of water around here as much as humanly possible.
